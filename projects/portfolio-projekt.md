My portfolio where I list some of the projects I have worked on.
<br />
<br />
Initially it was written using bootstrap, but recently remade from the ground up using Next.js and plain CSS.
<br />
<br />
The theme & colors are based on Hatsune Miku, and the layout was designed using as a reference the website web.dev.
<br />
<br />
The "Projekt" part of the name comes from German, and was added because of a strange influence the animated series Girls und Panzer had over me at the time of creation.
