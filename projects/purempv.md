Script that extends the functionality of the mpv media player, making it possible to extract the playing video file path, timestamps, and cropbox coordinates.

<br />
It was made to be used with ffmpeg, but it can also be used individually (extracting just the path/timestamps/cropbox), or within other mpv scripts using the shared data API.

This is one of my most beloved projects, and one that I use extensively, since I love making lots of short webms.
