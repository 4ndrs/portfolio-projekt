A web extension to search for anime, manga, characters, staff, and studios using the AniList's API.
<br />
<br />
It adds a new context menu option that can be clicked making a search bar (similar to the one on AniList) appear floating on the current page. If there is text selected, it will be used as a search term when clicking the option.
